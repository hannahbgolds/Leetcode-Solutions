# LeetCode Solutions 🏆

This repository contains my solutions for LeetCode problems. I am organizing them based on topic and difficulty. Each solution includes a brief explanation, approach, and complexity analysis.

## 📂 Structure
- **Difficulty:** `easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`
- **Topics:** `arrays/`, `graphs/`, `dynamic-programming/`, etc.

## 🚀 Goals
- Solve at least `4` problems per week
- Change topics every `2` weeks
- Take `2` days each week to study 

## 🛠️ How to Use
Each folder contains problem solutions with:
- **Code Implementation**
- **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**
- **Alternative Approaches (if applicable)**

Feel free to use my solutions for learning and reference. PRs and discussions are welcome!
